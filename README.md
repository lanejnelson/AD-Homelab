# AD-Homelab
Microsoft Active Directory is a feature-rich, centralized directory service used to manage and organize network resources, primarily in Windows environments. Active Directory (AD) can be used to allow users to access different workstations using the same user account, let system administrators remotely configure system settings, and much more. Active Directory can be used standalone, or alongside other services on a Windows Server machine. It is integral to many organizations and critical infrastructure and is used by over 95% of the Fortune 500 and provides critical services and infrastructure used in these companies. Active Directory skills are important for any sysadmins or cybersecurity enthusiasts due to the large userbase. With all that said, lets get into the setup of a home lab that you can use for practicing attacks or as a project to put on your resume for future employers to see.
